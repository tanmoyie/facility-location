### Facility location
A collaborative AI-powered data science project to solve facility-location optimization problem (ongoing). Please see our [Medium blog]([url](https://medium.com/p/aaa45ead9f71/edit)) for more details.

# Situation
We have five facilities to serve customers. We have two business problem to solve.
